Internalization records durable design facts from repository material into the configured lake.

This discipline owns the repository-to-lake direction.
Use it when source, tests, generated artifacts, configuration,
or non-lake documentation reveal a stable boundary, invariant, representation,
behavior, contract, or policy that future work should reason through.

`repository-editing-discipline` owns the shared edit method:
orientation, structural relation reading, witness inspection,
configuration alignment, documentation sync, validation, Tide handling, and staging.
Internalization adds the directional rule:
the repository supplies evidence,
but the fact becomes canonical only when an entry names it.

Internalization rejects changelog material.
Commit history can carry the sequence of edits.
The lake should carry the design that survived the edit
and will shape later work.

Choose the closest existing entry when it already names the fact.
Create a new compact entry when the fact belongs to a new boundary.
Apply semantic locality:
the entry should state the fact directly,
remain meaningful without its neighbors,
and use structural links only for navigation, review, or accountability.

Connect evidence without manufacturing it.
When repository evidence already exists,
add or refine a precise witness block around the smallest stable region that supports the entry.
If the entry holds prose only or evidence is not yet in the repository,
leave it unwitnessed and let actualization wire evidence later.

The static full-resource template lives in
`.artifacts/internalization-discipline/SKILL.full.template.md`
and is rendered by `src/mcp.rs` as `sirno://skills/sirno-internalizer`.
The packaged wrapper lives in `.artifacts/internalization-discipline/SKILL.md`
and renders to `.agents/skills/sirno-internalizer/SKILL.md`.
Those artifacts operationalize this discipline and the shared editing method;
the lake entry remains the source of the durable directional claim.
